# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to **Week 2** of our Java learning journey. This week was focused on mastering core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, exploring class design, and applying essential OOP features such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism in Java.

## Overview

This week introduced key object-oriented concepts and design principles using Java. Students learned how to build and model real-world entities as Java classes, use constructors, manage access with modifiers, and apply principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Topics Covered

### 01: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals
- Principles of OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
- Class and Object creation
- Real-world modeling using Java classes

### 02: Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers
- Types of constructors (default, parameterized)
- Use of `this` keyword in constructors
- Difference between instance and class (static) variables
- Understanding access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, default

### 03: `this`, `static`, `final` Keywords and `instanceof` Operator
- Meaning and usage of:
  - `this`: reference to the current object
  - `static`: class-level members
  - `final`: constants, final methods, and final classes
- Using `instanceof` to check object type at runtime

### 04: Object Modeling and Class Diagrams
- Basics of object modeling
- Designing class diagrams using UML
- Translating UML diagrams into Java code

### 05: Inheritance
- Creating subclasses using `extends`
- Method overriding
- `super` keyword
- Inheritance hierarchies

### 06: Encapsulation, Interface, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and use of getters/setters
- Abstract classes vs. Interfaces
- Implementing polymorphism through method overriding and dynamic binding
